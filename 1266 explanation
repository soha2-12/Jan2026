This problem is about finding the minimum time needed to move through a list of points in order, 
starting from the first point and visiting each next point one by one. You can move one unit per 
second either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The key idea is that diagonal movement is
very powerful because in one second it reduces both the x and y distance by 1 at the same time. So
, when moving from one point to the next, the fastest strategy is to move diagonally as much as possible, 
and then finish any remaining distance in a straight line. Because of this, the minimum time needed to go
from one point to another is simply the maximum of the horizontal distance and vertical distance between them.
The solution just loops through each consecutive pair of points, calculates this value, and adds it to a running total. 
In the end, that total represents the minimum time required to visit all the points in order.
