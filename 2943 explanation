This problem is about creating the largest possible square hole 
in a grid after removing some horizontal and vertical bars.
When you remove consecutive bars, they merge adjacent cells 
and effectively increase the usable length in that direction.
So the key idea is to find the longest sequence of consecutive 
removed horizontal bars and the longest sequence of consecutive
removed vertical bars. After sorting both lists, we scan them
to count how many bars are consecutive. If bars are consecutive,
we keep increasing a counter; if not, we reset it. The longest 
such streak in horizontal bars gives the maximum height expansion,
and similarly vertical bars give the width expansion. Since 
removing k consecutive bars creates a gap of k + 1 cells, we 
add 1 to both streaks. A square needs equal height and width,
so we take the minimum of the two expanded values as the side 
length. Finally, the area is just the side length squared.
