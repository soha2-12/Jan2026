The idea of this problem is to form the largest possible square by removing
some horizontal and vertical fences. First, we treat the field boundaries as
fences too, so we add 1 and m to the horizontal fence list and 1 and n to 
the vertical fence list, then sort them. From the horizontal fences, we 
calculate all possible vertical distances between every pair of fences 
and store them in a set, because these distances represent all possible 
heights of a square. Next, we iterate over every pair of vertical fences
and compute their distance, which represents a possible width. If this width
also exists in the horizontal distance set, then a square of that side 
length can be formed. For each valid square, we compute its area 
(side × side) and keep track of the maximum one found. If no square is 
possible, we return -1; otherwise, we return the maximum area modulo 
10^9 + 7 .
