In this problem, each square contributes area between its bottom y-coordinate and top y-coordinate.
Instead of thinking in terms of full squares, we imagine sweeping a horizontal line from bottom to top 
and counting how much square area lies below that line. For every square, we mark two events: when the
sweep line enters the square (at y) and when it leaves the square (at y + side length). As we move upward 
through these sorted events, we keep track of the total horizontal width currently covered by squares. 
The area gained while moving from one y-level to the next is simply this width multiplied by the vertical 
distance moved. We keep adding these area chunks until the accumulated area reaches half of the total area
of all squares. When that happens, the required y-coordinate lies between the previous y and the current y, 
so we compute the exact position using simple proportional calculation. This gives the smallest y where the 
area below equals the area above.
