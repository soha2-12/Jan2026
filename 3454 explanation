This problem asks us to draw a horizontal line such that the unique area covered by 
all squares above the line equals the unique area below it, even when squares overlap.
To handle overlaps correctly, we imagine sweeping a horizontal line from bottom to top
and tracking which parts of the x-axis are currently covered by active squares. As the 
sweep line moves upward, the area added is simply the covered width on the x-axis
multiplied by the vertical distance moved. First, we compute the total union area of
all squares, then target half of that area. During the second sweep, we keep accumulating 
area until we reach (or cross) half of the total; when that happens, we precisely calculate
how far upward the line needs to move within the current strip to balance the areas.
Because overlapping regions are counted only once and the sweep always moves upward,
the first y-value where this balance occurs is the minimum valid answer, which is exactly
what the problem asks for.
