This program finds the minimum number of pair
removal operations needed to make an array sorted.
It uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always
select the adjacent pair with the smallest sum
for merging. A doubly linked list is simulated
using index arrays to efficiently maintain 
neighboring elements after each merge. 
The algorithm also maintains an inversion count 
to check whether the array is sorted; an inversion
occurs when an element is greater than its next
element. During each iteration, the smallest 
valid adjacent pair is merged, the linked list is
updated, inversion counts are adjusted, and new
adjacent pairs are inserted into the heap. 
The process continues until all inversions are 
removed, meaning the array is sorted. The number 
of merge operations performed is returned as the
final result.
