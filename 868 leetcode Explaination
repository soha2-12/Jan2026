Problem in Simple Words

You are given a number n.
Convert it to binary
Find distances between consecutive 1s
Return the largest distance

Solution Idea:
Instead of converting to a string, we scan bits directly.
We keep track of:
current bit position
last position where we saw a 1
maximum gap so far
Every time we see a new 1:

        last = -1      # position of previous 1
        ans = 0        # maximum gap
        i = 0          # current bit position

       if n & 1:           # if current bit is 1

            n >>= 1             # remove last bit
            i += 1              # move to next position

1. Read bits from RIGHT → LEFT
   10110 → start from rightmost 0
2. Check if current bit is 1
   n & 1
   returns 1 → bit is 1
   returns 0 → bit is 0
3. When a 1 is found
  If we already saw a previous 1:
  gap = current_position − previous_position
  Update maximum gap.
4. Shift right
  n >>= 1
  Removes last bit.
  10110 → 1011 → 101 → 10 → 1 → 0
